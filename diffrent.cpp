// What is the difference between OOP and POP?
 
/* 
  
They both have different work approaches. 
On the one hand, the OOP style of programming divides a program into objects, 
whereas POP divides it into functions. As thereâ€™s no direct approach for a particular problem, a programmer uses programming languages.
OPP :-  object oriented programming
POP :- Conventional programming,using high level language such as COBOL,
       Fortran and commonly known as procedure-oriented programming(POP)
